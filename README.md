Steps to run the project:

1.These 3 files are needed to run this project:

a. Project_main.R
b. Project_feature_cluster.R
c. Project_ssn.R

2. a) protein_links.txt and b) prob.BRCA.N.exp.RData, these
two data file must be downloaded from the original source
mentioned in the paper.

k <- read.table("protein_links.txt", sep = " ", header = TRUE)
pb <- load("prob.BRCA.N.exp.RData")

3.These three files must be kept in the same workspace
where the source code is. These files hold data with some
basic calculations needed throughout the project.

a. Network_btwns_centrality.Rda
b. gene_1080_1047.Rda
c. gid_pid_gsymbol.Rda

Other necessary file will be generated by the source code.
